		<h2 class="w3-text-teal">What is Unhashit?</h2>
		<p>With Unhashit you can decrypt hashes into original text. You also can generate hashes using different algorithms. Hashes are used for many applications like security, authentication and others.</p>
		<h2 class="w3-text-teal">What is a Hash?</h2>
		<p>A hash, or hash function is a function that can be used to convert data of any size to a much smaller size. It's like a fingerprint of the data. The result of a hash function are called hash code, digest, hash value or simply hash. If the data changes just a little bit, the resulting hash will change completely. Until now it was very difficult to reconstruct data just from the hash value. Unhashit has built a giant database of precomputed inputs and their corresponding hashes. With that database you can reverse / decrypt / reconstruct a hash into it's initial form super fast.</p>

		<h2 class="w3-text-teal">What hashes does Unhashit support?</h2>
		<p>We support MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512. Unhashit is adding new hashes constantly.</p>
		<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Where do the hashes come from?</h2>
		<p>Every time a user of Unhashit generates a hash, the hash is also stored for later reverse/decryption.</p>
