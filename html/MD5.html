<p><b>MD5 (128 bit)</b> (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely-used cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash value. MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function, MD4. As an Internet standard, MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications, and is also commonly used to check the integrity of files.
